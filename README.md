My name is Matthew Musgrave and my background is in finance and regulatory risk.

My career goals are to become a Fintech professional who is working on leading edge projects that are helping to reshape the finance landscape.

I chose Fintech as a career path becasue the nature of the industry is fast moving and innovative which makes for a working atmosphere that will never be stagnat and boring.
